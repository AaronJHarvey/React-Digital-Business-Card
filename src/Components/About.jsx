			<p>
				I am a fullstack developer with a particular interest in the frontend. I enjoy making things simple and
				easy to navigate and understand for the user while also ensuring they are well built, maintained, and
				working properly so as to create a more seemless experience. Put another way - I'm constantly trying to
				make computers do their computer things.
